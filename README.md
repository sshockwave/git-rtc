## Why JavaScript?

I believe that js is one of the more permanent languages with good portability, open web standards without depending on a single company or compiler, and probably the widest end-user support. Rust is a more efficient alternative which can be compiled to WebAssembly, but I consider it a transitional technology before a mathematically provable language arrives.
